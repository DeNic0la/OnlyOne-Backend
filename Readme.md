# OpenApi generation

## Start backend application locally

Currently to start the application you need to have a IntelliJ Installation.
First you open the project in IntelliJ. 
Then in the Maven menu in IntelliJ you run install on "openapi-spring" or in the console move to the folder "openapi-spring" and run `../mvnw install`.
Afterwards in IntelliJ on the top right select the application "OnlyOneSpringApplication" and run it (by pressing the green arrow next to it).
